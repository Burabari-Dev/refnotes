# Introduction

This project is meant to be an application that would help someone learning a programming course or bootcamp to document
the leaning journey on a well formatted website for easy reference later on.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This version is created with JavaScript and React. I may make other versions using TypeScript and React, Next.Js, Vite, Angular etc.

## Main Concepts

- The idea is to breakdown the learning areas according to technologies.
- For each technology, there would be learning modules.
- Each module would have content which can be either a list/series of information paragraphs or code-blocks saved in a specific order.
- The information paragraphs or code-blocks an be grouped together to show different approaches depending on the technology or programming language in use.
- There would be two primary interfaces to intaract with this application:
  - The first would be the **documenting** interface, where the learner would document what he has learnt.
  - The second would be the **referenceing** interface wehre the learner can review what he documented.
- Progress of the learner can also be tracked when revisiting the referencing interface.

This is meant for private use so there would be some sort of authentication for allowed users but no public signup feature.
